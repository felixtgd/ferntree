                  When deciding whether or not to purchase a photovoltaic system
                  for your own home, you are confronted with many questions: How
                  big does the PV system need to be? Does a battery make sense?
                  How much will this investment cost and does it make economic
                  sense for me?
                </span>
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <span>
                  There are a large number of websites on the Internet,
                  especially solar calculators, which are supposed to help you
                  make this decision. At the same time, however, they have a
                  commercial interest in selling solar systems. These resources
                  therefore often offer distorted information to tempt potential
                  buyers into making a purchase. It is therefore almost
                  impossible to form an unbiased opinion based on objective and
                  undistorted data. In most cases, all you get is the statement
                  that an investment is worthwhile, and shortly afterwards you
                  are flooded with spam e-mails with sales offers.

                  Ferntree does not have this conflict. We simply want to
                  help people make informed decisions, so that everyone can
                  decide on their own, what type of energy system makes the most
                  sense for them.

                  Every person, with or without technical knowledge, should be

                  Our tool allows you to freely design and simulate different
                  energy systems, compare them with each other and set your
                  individual financial parameters. Try out for yourself when a
                  battery makes sense for you. Investigate the conditions under
                  which an investment is worthwhile for you. We don&apos;t give
                  you any guidelines. You have full control. We simply provide
                  you with the tools you need to make an informed decision on
                  your own. And best of all: it&apos;s free to use. Get started
                  now and try it out!
